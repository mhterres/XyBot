Installation
************

This document supposes the following scenario:

* All requirements are ok (docs/Requeriments)
* Asterisk was compiled from source
* Asterisk is using the english language
* Asterisk is using PJSIP

If you have a different scenario, you will need to change some directories in following operations.

XMPP
****

First, create a xybot XMPP account in your XMPP server.

PostgreSQL
**********

Create an user and database with name xybot and import the .sql file in database.

su - postgres
createuser -P -S -D -R xybot
createdb -O xybot xybot
exit
cat db/dbpgsql.sql | psql -U xybot -W xybot -h 127.0.0.1

If you are using Asterisk Realtime, you can add some columns in your own sip peer table (see db/asterisk_dbpgsql_sample.sql - special attention to xmpp_* columns).

If you are not using Asterisk Realtime or you don't want to alter your database (recommended), you can use the sample asterisk database. To use it, run this commands:

su - postgres
createuser -P -S -D -R asterisk_xybot
createdb -O asterisk_xybot asterisk_xybot
exit
cat db/asterisk_dbpgsql_sample.sql | psql -U asterisk_xybot -W asterisk_xybot -h 127.0.0.1

If you used your own database, fill the xmpp_* columns in your records. If you are using the sample database, create the extensions on sip table.

Asterisk
********

Create a new manager user (/etc/asterisk/manager.conf) that will be used by XyBot (sample configuration file in asterisk/etc/manager.conf.sample). 

After create the new user, reload the manager configuration in Asterisk.

Final configurations
********************

Access XyBot directory and run this commands:

mkdir /etc/xybot
cp config/xybot.conf.sample /etc/xybot/xybot.conf

Edit file /etc/xybot/xybot.conf and adjust the parameters


SAMPLES
*******
If you want to use queuemonitorholdtime monitor and/or playmsg plugin, you should use the sample data in samples subdirectory.
