The project
***********

The main goal of this project is to enable users to interact with Asterisk directly from XMPP client.

Using the PoC
*************

After installation is completed, you need to access XyBot directory and run the xybot.py script (cd XyBot && ./xybot.py &).

Enter the conference room and start talking with the xybot user.

Monitors
********

The XyBot monitor structure allows you to create new monitors. The monitor consists of two files: the monitor (.mon) that must be inside the monitor subdirectory and the script, which must be inside the monitor/scripts subdirectory.

The monitor file (.mon) is a simple ini file and you can find more informations about it in monitor/README file.

The script can be written in any language that you want (python, perl, php, bash, etc...). The script must return the information that will be used in monitor message.

The available scripts are:
 
* iaxpeerstatus - send a message when the status of an iax peer changes.
* asteriskprocess - send a message when the status of Asterisk process changes.
* queuemonitorholdtime - send a message if the hold time of a queue is greater than the maximum hold time allowed. Send another message when hold time returns to acceptable values.

Plugins
*******

The XyBot plugins structure allows you to create new plugins. The plugin consists of two files: the config file (.yapsy-plugin) and the python script. Both files must be inside the plugins subdirectory.

The config file (.yapsy-plugin) is a simple ini file and you can find more informations about it in plugins/README file.

The plugins scripts are created using Yapsy and you can find more information about it at http://yapsy.sourceforge.net/.

The available plugins are:
 
* bot_changelog: exhibit the bot changelog
* call: make a call to an extensions, if jid has permission
* enterqueue: add extension in a queue
* help: show help
* history: list history of MUC
* last: list last logons and logoffs
