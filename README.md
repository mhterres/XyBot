# XyBot
XMPP MUC bot that interacts with Asterisk - Proof of Concept

This project (PoC) shows the possibilities of use of an XMPP bot integrated with an Asterisk server.

The goal of this project is to allow users to control their Asterisk extensions directly from their XMPP client. The project was developed to be generic as possible, using plugins to add new features to bot. Also, you can use the XyBot to monitor services or anything else you want.

The directories contains:

* asterisk/etc - asterisk configuration samples (xmpp and manager)
* config - sample configuration file
* db - database schema and asterisk database sample schema
* docs - documentation
* monitor - monitor files
* monitor/scripts - scripts used by monitor files
* plugins - plugins files
* samples - sample files for some plugins and monitor items
* tests - scripts for testing
