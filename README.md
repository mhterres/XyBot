# XyBot
XMPP MUC bot that interacts with Asterisk - Proof of Concept

This project (PoC) shows the possibilities of use of an XMPP bot integrated with an Asterisk server.

The main goal of this project is to enable users to interact with asterisk directly from your XMPP client.

Xybot was built to provide an expandable structure of plugins and monitors that allow system administrators to deploy their own resources.

The directories contains:

* asterisk/etc - asterisk configuration samples (xmpp and manager)
* config - sample configuration file
* db - database schema and asterisk database sample schema
* docs - documentation
* monitor - monitor files
* monitor/scripts - scripts used by monitor files
* plugins - plugins files
* samples - sample files for some plugins and monitor items
* tests - scripts for testing
